# Starter password security chatbot
# Start here

    # Decide how users will interact with this
    # (for example: typing questions, choosing from options, etc.)

    # Think about common password questions users might ask
    # Examples:
    # - What makes a password strong?
    # - Why is password reuse bad?
    # - What is MFA?

    # Match user input to simple responses

    # Keep explanations short and beginner-friendly


    # If you want something a bit more complex, you can try to:
    # - store questions and answers in a dictionary or file
    # - improve how input is matched to answers
    # - add a help or topics command
