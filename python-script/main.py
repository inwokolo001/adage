# Starter Python password generator
# Start here

def main():
    print("Password generator starting point")

    # Ask the user how long the password should be

    # Decide what types of characters to include
    # (letters, numbers, symbols)

    # Generate the password

    # Show the result to the user

    # If you want something a bit more complex, you can try to:
    # - check how strong the password is
    # - use command-line arguments instead of input()
    # - save the passwords to a file
