Password Security Notes

This folder is for thinking about password security from a defensive point of view.

You could research and write about:
- common password mistakes
- brute force attacks
- password reuse
- basic best practices

This section does not need to include, one thing i would say is that if you're interested in security, you can start by building your own home server as a hub. Go to the week 4 section of the google classroom, I have something on that.
