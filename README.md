# adage

This week’s project is built around one shared idea: password security.

I chose this topic because it’s something that can be approached in a lot of different ways. Some people might want to write code, some might want to design an interface, some people might be interested in security or mobile apps. Instead of everyone building separate projects, we’re all working on different parts of the same idea.

You’ll work in the section that matches what you’re interested in. The hope is that within a week, we should have one system that shows how all these pieces fit together.

How this week works:

1. Everyone works from the same GitHub repository.  
2. Each person tries to complete at least one task.  
3. Each person should submit at least one pull request with that task in mind.  
4. Optionally, if you want to get creative, or work on multiple things, you can, but remember, it’s optional.

Note: You don’t need to understand the whole repo. Just the parts that you're interested in.

You’ll mainly work inside your own section folder.

Sections you can choose from:

Python  
This section is about writing a small program that generates strong passwords. You’ll control things like length, characters, and get feedback on how strong the password is. This is a good fit if you’re learning Python or want more practice.

Java  
This is the same general idea as the Python section, but written in Java instead. It’s useful if you’re more comfortable with Java or want to see how different languages solve the same problem.

Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)  
This section focuses on building a simple webpage where users can generate passwords. Think sliders, buttons, strength indicators, and a clean design. Good if you like visual or frontend work.

AI / Chatbot  
This section is about helping users understand password security. You’ll build something that answers common questions like why password reuse is bad or what makes a password strong. No need to worry about hosting right now.

Cybersecurity  
This section focuses on defensive thinking. You’ll look at how password systems fail in the real world and how they’re protected. This is more about documentation, policies, and reasoning than hacking.

iOS / Xcode  
This section focuses on building a simple iPhone app that generates secure passwords. Users can adjust settings, see strength, and copy the password.

How to submit:

1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a new branch.  
3. Complete your section’s task.  
4. Open a pull request explaining what you did.  

That’s it.

The goal here is to show how one idea can be explored in many ways and how different roles can work together using GitHub. This is meant to be practical, realistic, and something you can actually talk about later.

Let’s keep it simple and build something useful.
